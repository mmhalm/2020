# 2020

This repository consists of my projects from 2020. These include the coursework done for the course "Analysis of Biomedical Images", 
Fiji image analysis macros done during the summer for the automation of biomedical image analysis in a research group, and lastly
a project made just for fun to calculate my GPA from a pdf file.
Note, that almost all of these projects need some kind of dataset in order to work and those datasets are not provided in the folders.

### Analysis of Biomedical Images

In this folder there are two different projects that were done for the course. In these I used OpenCV for image analysis. There is a more
specific explanation for each project there within the folders. 

### Fiji

This folder consists of projects that were done during the summer 2020 in order to automate biomedical image analysis for the research
group I was working with during the summer. I learned the macro language over the summer with only prior knowledge of Python.
Therefore, the macro scripts are far from perfect, but they work and in case of a need those could be perfected now that I have
gained som knowledge of Java too, since the macro language reminds Java. 
The scripts in this folder are mainly just to see what can I do and learn during a three month period. These were only a side project
of my work. The scripts are mainly made for the analysis of multi channel immunofluorescence images.

### Random projects

This folder only has one script, that was made for fun to calculate my GPA from a pdf file. You see, adding all the grades from the 
paper and keeping count of the total number of grades was too much of a work and too tedious, so I made a script do that for me instead.
