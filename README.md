# 2020

This repository consists of my projects from 2020. These include the coursework done for the course "Analysis of Biomedical Images", 
image analysis macros done during the summer for the automation of biomedical image analysis in a research group, and lastly
a project made just for fun to calculate my GPA from a pdf file.
