Scripts of type .ijm are written in ImageJ / Fiji macro language and they
can be used in Fiji, a software used for biomedical image analysis.
These scripts were made to make the analysis of certain type of 
biomedical images more automatized and faster. Some of the scripts need
certain plugins in order to work correctly.
